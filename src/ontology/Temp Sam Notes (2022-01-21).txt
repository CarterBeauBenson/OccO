But as it turned out, the error was due to failure to resolve the 
DCAT file's owl:imports statement for Dublin Core Terms. 
The Dublin Core group had updated its URL where the DC Terms file could be found, so the import failed. When I updated the owl:imports statement to the new URL, it worked fine. Happy ending.

However, the error message WebProtege provided didn't indicate that the import failed. Rather, it sent me down a rabbit hole of trying to clear my cache and refresh my browser. So it'd be great if WebProtege's error handling were more accurate for import errors, which happen all the time.

Here's a sample of the Java error log for reference

Oliver – I have updated Major Groups, Minor Groups, Broad Occupations and Detailed Occupations and would like to use OntoRat to create the OWL.
However, I do not have the settings file that I think is needed.  
If there is one, could you email it to me?
Thanks – have a good weekend.
Sam
