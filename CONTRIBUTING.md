## Guidelines for Contributions and Requests

<a id="reporting-bugs"></a>

### Reporting problems with the ontology

Please use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Occupation-Ontology/OccO/issues/) for reporting problems with the ontology. 
To learn how to write a good issue [see here](#great-issues).

<a id="requesting-terms"></a>

### Requesting new terms

Before you write a new request, please consider the following: 

- **Does the term already exist?** Before submitting suggestions for new ontology terms, check whether the term exist, 
either as a primary term or a synonym term. You can search for your term using [Ontobee](https://ontobee.org) or [OLS](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/OccO).
- **Can you provide a definition for the term?** It should be very clear what the term means, and you should be
able to provide a concise definition, ideally with a scientific reference.
- **Is the ontology in scope for the term?** Sometimes, it is hard to tell whether a term "belongs" in
and ontology. A rule of thumb is "if a similar term already exists, the new term is probably in scope."
It can be very helpful to mention a very similar concept as part of the term request!

#### Who can request a term?

Anyone can request new terms. However, there is not guarantee that your term will be added automatically. Since this is a 
community resource, it is often necessary to do at least some of the work of adding the term yourself, see below.

#### How to write a new term request

Request a new term _via_ the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Occupation-Ontology/OccO/issues/).

It is important to remember that it takes a lot of time for curators to process issues submitted to the tracker.
To make this work easier, please always use issue templates if they are available (https://github.com/Occupation-Ontology/OccO/issues/new/choose).

For how to write a good term request, please read the [best practices carefully](#great-issues).
