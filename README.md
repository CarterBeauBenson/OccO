OccO: Occupation Ontology

The Occupation Ontology (OccO) is an ontology in the domain of human occupations. OccO standardizes and represented all the occupations defined in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System from the USA Bureau of Labor Statistics. OccO is developed by following the OBO Foundry principles. 

OccO is co-developed by Sam Smith and Oliver He, at the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 

OccO was initially developed as part of the Role Ontology (RoleO) as seen here in BioPortal: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ROLEO.
