OccO: Occupation Ontology

The Occupation Ontology (OccO) is an ontology in the domain of human occupations. OccO is an initial ontological presentation of information taken from a standardized occupation taxonomy, the US Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) as enhanced by the **O*Net** system.  These systems have been developed by the following US Federal agencies:
- Department of Labor 
- Bureau of Labor Statistics
- The O\*NET Program, the United States' primary source of occupational information. 

OccO reflects the data content of the **O\*Net-SOC 2019** taxonomy, which is based on the 2018 SOC, and it is developed by following OBO Foundry principles. 

OccO is co-developed by Sam Smith and Oliver He, at the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, with the assistance of Damion Dooley of Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC, Canada. 

OccO was initially developed as part of the Role Ontology (RoleO) as seen here in BioPortal: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ROLEO.
